# Optimisation-of-Parallel-Machine-Scheduling-using-Genetic-Algorithm-Project

- Genetic algorithm which is a well-known metaheuristic approach inspired by the process of natural selection that iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions using operations like crossover and mutation to find approximate solutions to complex problems was used as the main optimisation solver for the parallel machine scheduling problem.
  
- Developed and implemented a Genetic Algorithm in Python to optimise production scheduling by minimising total job tardiness under multiple operational constraints, including processing times, setup times, due dates, order quantities, machine availability, and capacity limitations.
  
- Designed a tardiness-based fitness function and implemented a parameter evaluation framework to analyse the impact of population size, mutation rate, and number of generations, enabling selection of high-performing algorithm configurations.
  
- Implemented evolutionary search procedures including customised crossover and mutation operators, along with feasibility control mechanisms to ensure machine capacity and working time constraints were satisfied throughout the optimisation process.
  
- Generated optimised production schedules across multiple generations and analysed convergence behaviour to evaluate scheduling performance improvements.
  
- Developed detailed schedule visualisations using Gantt charts to represent machine assignments, processing intervals, and sequencing structure.

- Produced comprehensive scheduling outputs including job start times, completion times, and tardiness metrics to support performance evaluation and decision analysis.
